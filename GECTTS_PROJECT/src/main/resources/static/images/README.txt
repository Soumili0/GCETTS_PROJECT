Place the campus image here as `college.jpg` for the About page.

Steps:
1. Save your image (the one you attached in the chat) as `college.jpg`.
2. Put it in this folder: src/main/resources/static/images/college.jpg
3. Restart the application (or refresh static resources) and open /about to see the image.

If the filename is different, update the `th:src` in `templates/about.html` accordingly.
